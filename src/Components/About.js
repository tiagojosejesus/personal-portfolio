      <div>
        <p>
          Since I started learning Front-End Development, I took the interest in
          programming in ReactJs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the short experience in developing App's in ReactJs, i enjoy
          programming in this framework. The interest in the language came from
          a bad experience in a student intern. The language used was C# and
          jQuery, but my interest wasn't there.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the end of the student intern, I developed my first program in
          ReactJs, making a simples ToDo List. When i finish this app, the
          interest in programming in ReactJs grown and I decide to make my
          career in the framework.
